# Cubing Timer Overview

`index.html` provides a simple timer for puzzle solving with built-in scramble generation. Scrambles for common WCA events are powered by the cubejs library loaded from a CDN. Open the file directly or serve it through a simple static server.

Run locally with:

```
npx serve
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000/index.html` in your browser. All code and markup live in that single file for easier testing and contributions.
