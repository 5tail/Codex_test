# Cubing Timer Overview

`index.php` provides a simple timer for puzzle solving with built-in scramble generation. Load it through any PHP-enabled server to track your solves.

Run locally with:

```
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/index.php` in your browser. All code and markup live in that single file for easier testing and contributions.
